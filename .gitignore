# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as a user you should not edit
#  them directly, but in the script that does it for you.
#  - In this case you can ignore the generated files.
#  - If they are not written for you, and you have to edit them manually,
#    then do not ignore them.
#    (Also, use the script method to generate them, as it's much easier).
